## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

## My process

- I coded the mobile version first so I could focus on improving the layout based ont he screen device. There are several break points because the small details that need to change based on the different screen sizes.

- I coded a simple script file containing the logic behind the open and close process. The dropdown opens if the user clicks the product link, and closes when the close icon is clicked.

- The main section of the site is divided by two collumn grids. The first collumn is the main title with the subtitle and the call to action button. The other collumn is a image containing a application user profile photo.

- The last section is a responsive brand companies grid.

## Biggest Challenges

- Adapt the grid to large screens is a proccess that always require a lot of thought and experimentation. I needed to let the project aside for a few days so I could return and finish the site later.
